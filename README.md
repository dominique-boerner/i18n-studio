[![test & check packages](https://github.com/dominique-boerner/i18n-studio/actions/workflows/nodejs.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dominique-boerner/i18n-studio/actions/workflows/nodejs.yaml)

i18n-Studio is a self-hosted solution for managing translation files. It helps with:

* **file analyzing**: Analysis of the translation files for errors or different keys.
* **adding translations**: Add translations across multiple files via a UI to prevent errors.
* **provide translations**: Provide translations for your application via a modern REST API.

> This project is currently a work in progress. The above features
do not yet correspond to the project, and are only planned.

## Understand this workspace

The workspace is a monorepo that uses [NX](https://nx.dev/). Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the
dependencies of the projects.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

To install the project, the following things are needed:

* [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download): 16.x
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

### Checkout

Clone this repository via:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dominique-boerner/i18n-studio.git 
```

### Install

Navigate into the repository and install the dependencies via:

```bash
$ cd i18n-studio
$ npm install
```

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Development server

The project is divided into two applications:

### frontend

The front-end is a VueJS application using TailwindCSS. It connects to the studio-adapter
via [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and provide a UI to perform various CRUD actions.

To serve the frontend run this command:

```bash 
$ npm run serve:frontend
```

### studio-adapter

This adapter is used for I/O with the file system. It reads the files from a specific
folder and stream them via [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to the frontend. Every operation
with the file system should be handled by the studio-adapter.

To serve the adapter, run this command:

```bash 
$ npm run serve:adapter
```

## üêã Run via Docker

It is possible to start i18n-studio in a Docker environment. To start the application as Docker,
the following command must be executed:

```bash
$ npm run docker:compose
```

This command will run docker build and docker compose up on your machine. When the container has
been created, the front end is located at http://localhost:3000.

## ‚úÖ Dependency check

The project uses a dependency checker [(Snyk)](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/check-packages) to
monitor the health of NPM packages. Since i18n-studio connects directly to the file system via the adapter,
we want to offer users the highest possible security and prevent vulnerabilities.

## Dependency Blacklisting

If NPM packages should be forbidden from the project, they must be included in the
```packages-blacklist.json```.

The package health check can be launched via:

```bash 
$ check-packages --blacklist
```

## üìã Features

Below you will find a list of planned features. The list is not complete and
can be extended at any time.

> The corresponding issue tickets were added later. Therefore, it is possible that not every feature contains an issue.
